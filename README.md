**I'm a newcomer in the web development world, but I'm looking to <sup>_level up_</sup> !**

3 facts about me:
1. I currently work in healthcare :hospital:, but am looking for a career change.
2. I have a cat named Beemo :cat: and another named Ube :cat: - cats are everything (but, so are my kids lol).
3. The last time I dabbled with HTML was when Xanga was a thing... :upside_down_face:
